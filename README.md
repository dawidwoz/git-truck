# Description

Git-Truck provides you with a truckload of visualizations for your git repository, and helps you find out if your project has a good [truck factor](https://www.agileadvice.com/2005/05/15/agilemanagement/truck-factor/):

### What makes Git Truck Beta different?

- Private by design
- Works offline
- Git provider agnostic - Works with any Git repository
- No tracking, no ads, no data mining, no analytics, no cloud, no servers


## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To use Git Truck Beta , you will need to have the following programs installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.13 or newer
- npm 6.14 or newer
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.29 or newer

To check if these programs are installed, and what version you have, run `node --version`, `npm --version` and `git --version`. If any of these are not installed on your system, or are just very old, they can be installed from the links above. Note that `npm` is installed along with `node`.

## [Get started](#get-started)

1. Within a git repository, or a directory containing git repositories, run the command `npx -y git-truck`.
2. The application will now open in your default browser.

Please contact Dawid Wozniak by email [dawo@itu.dk](mailto:dawo@itu.dk)

## [Advanced use](#advanced-use)

Run `npx git-truck` in the root of a git repository, that you want to visualize:

```sh
npx git-truck [args]
```

### [Arguments](#arguments)

|         arg          |                              description                              |   default value    |
| :------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------: |
|       `--path`       |                 path to a folder or a git repository                  | current directory  |
|       `--log`        | output log level. See [here](./src/analyzer/log.server.ts) for values |         -          |
|       `--port`       |                      port to use for the program                      |        3000        |
| `--invalidate-cache` |                    bypass analyzer cache manually                     |         -          |
| `--headless`         |       run the program without opening the browser                     |         -          |

**Note:** Using `--invalidate-cache` will cause the analyzer to run every time the client talks to the server.

### [Configuration](#configuration)

You can add a `truckconfig.json` file to the root of your project, where you can define the arguments you want.
Additionally you can define which git-aliases should be considered as the same person using `unionedAuthors`. If provided, the first name in the array is used as the name of the person.
You can also define files to ignore.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "log": "debug",
  "branch": "main",
  "unionedAuthors": [
    ["Bob", "Bobby Bob"],
    ["Alice", "aliiii", "alice alice"]
  ],
  "hiddenFiles": ["package-lock.json", "*.bin", "*.svg"],
  "invalidateCache": true
}
```
